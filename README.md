# AutoIT-Card-Game
A windows-only card game with a simple AI opponent and variety of card effects.

Main executable file is called 'Card Game': to play, select cards from your hand each turn to play until you run out of mana for that turn,
and with that try to bring the opponent's health to 0. Some cards inflict status conditions that reduce, negate or increase the opponent's
damage: because only one is active at a time, choose the order you play them in carefully. The opponent will deal a random amount of damage
each turn, and occasionally play a field card that describes a new rule of the game in the bottom right corner.

To choose the cards in your deck more selectively, use 'Deck Builder' before launching a game to set the cards which have a chance of being
drawn each turn.
